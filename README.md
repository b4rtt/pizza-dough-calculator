### UI Designer wanted badly!<!-- omit from toc -->

If you're a UI designer and you're reading this ... and if you agree with the one-page and one page alone decision, then please help me out!

Here's what I'd want:

- A simple, clean, and modern design, productive and easy to use
- A responsive design (mobile first, tablet best, desktop nice)
- Make it easy to read and easy to follow along (while making dough in the kitchen)
- Animations or transitions only if they add value
- use of vanilla/modern css (no bootstrap, no tailwind or similar)
