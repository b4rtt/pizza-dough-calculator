# Hello, (hungry) Pizza-Dough-Developer!

this is a very basic [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) project. The linked Readme/Documentation is plentyful to help you get going.

## VS Code + Calva

This is how I do it with Node 16.17.0 and Clojure installed in VS Code:

1. from the command palette (Shift+CMD+P) `Start a REPL and Connect (aka Jack-In)`
2. check ":frontend" + ":test" when prompted
3. ☕️
4. visit [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)
5. develop with the REPL
